# NewsApp

<pre>

This is a News Web Application developed as the final project at Oracle Academy Club.
It uses a database in which we store all the information regarding the accounts, news, comments etc.
It has session control management, so you can Login as an Guest, Autor or User and have different options depending on what account you have.
Uses Java for the back-end and HTML and CSS for the front end.
It takes the connection details to the tabase from a json file so make sure you update that .json file if you want to run it on your computer.
